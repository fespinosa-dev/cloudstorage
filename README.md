Super*Duper*Drive is a simple cloud storage web application that lets you manage and store files, notes and passwords.

## Features

1. **Simple File Storage:** Upload/download/remove files
2. **Note Management:** Add/update/remove text notes
3. **Password Management:** Save, edit, and delete website credentials.  

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `dev.fespinosa.cloudstorage.CloudStorageApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
